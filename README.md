## NSSP
Collection of Data Analysis of Neural Signals &amp; Signal Processing projects.

This repository contains code and reports for 3 projects:


> **fMRI-moco**: Motion Correction Anaylsis of FSLeyes methods on fMRI data, where quality control metrics were computed such as framewise displacement & DVARS. 


> **fMRI-functional-connectivity**: Spatial components of ICA were computed of subjects while watching a movie to identify brain areas correlated with vision & resting state. Functional connectivity network was also derived through voxel correlation analysis and independent component projection of a bipartite graph using different brain atlases.


> **blind-source-separation** Identification of muscle synergies in sEMG data of patients with transradial electrode arrays (8x8) being placed on the ventral and dorsal side of the forearm. Synergy stabiltiy was computed accross different BSS algorithms (PCA, ICA, NMF, PCA-ICA) and different slices of the experimental data.
